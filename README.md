# Assignment 4: Undirected & Directed Graphs

Analysis' of undirected graphs, directed graphs, time complexity of V and E, BFS algorithm, DFS and BFS Trace, iterative DFS and recursive BFS, and linear time alogrithm.

Question 1: prove exact time complexity in terms of V and E for 4 cases:

• undirected graphs adjaceny matrix representation

• undirected graphs adjaceny list representation

• directed graphs adjaceny matrix representation

• directed graphs adjaceny list representation

Question 2: do a DFS and BFS trace in form of horizontal table for undirected graph

Question 3: do a DFS and BFS trace in form of horizontal table for directed graph

Question 4: write pseudo code (format on a numbered list) and prove Big-Oh time complexity (in terms of V and E) for 2 cases:

• Iterative DFS

• Recursive BFS

Question 5: write pseudocode to solve an Undirected Graph, provide stack trace of algorithm in tabular form

Question 6: like Question 5 write presuodcode to solve an another Undirected Graph, provide stack trace of algorithm in tabular form

Question 7: use pseudocode to describe a linear time algorithm for fundamental sets, show complexity in terms of V and E, provide stack trace of algorithm in tabular form
